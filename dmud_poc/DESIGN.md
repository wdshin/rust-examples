* user
* player
* How to structure monster ?
  * snoop target monster must be possible
    * watching
  * The immortal must be able to enter the monster.
    * Instead of an AI controller, it should be maneuverable.
  * AI controller must be attached.
    * It's good to be able to make it with only data.
  * Are monsters also players?
    * No!
    * they are Characters.
