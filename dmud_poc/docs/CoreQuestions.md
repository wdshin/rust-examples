* What is the problem that youâ€™re solving?
  * We want to help gamers to easily make interactive online games 100% on-chain. 
  * This is difficult because there is no easy way to 1) stream live information on-chain and 2) incentivize individual game creators . 
  * Streaming of information is extremely difficult using current blockchain networks and this limits the interactive nature of online games. 
  * This is one of the main reasons we have not seen MMOGs built 100% on-chain. The polling model can be adopted to a certain extent but this is not suitable or sustainable for a real time interactive game environment with mass players.
  * Also, there is no easy way to effectively incentivize micro studios and individual game creators for their creativity using a conventional web3 value share model. 
  * The conventional model is designed to incentivize players for their play but no real progress has been made in exploiting the creative inertia of gamers and amateur creators.

* Expand on the product that you're building
  * dMud V1 is a text based on-chain open world MMORPG. 
  * The users can use dMud to create their own text based MMORPG games or simply participate as players to play the games created by other users. 
  * The creators, also known as the wizards / immortals, are the architects of a game world. They have the power to design a whole game environment and rules using dMud Creator Studio, which is a text based interface for creators to create games using a natural language. 
  * The players are known as mortals, they can interact with other players to build guilds to complete quests and also fight other players to loot their game items (NFTs / FTs). 
  * At the guild, the players share their knowledge and game experience. The guild masters can make suggestions to wizards / immortals to improve the gameplay experience. 
  * The user generated games will be curated and rewarded according to active users, transactions and likes from players.
  * Technically, the dMud consists of two parts. 
    * The dMud VM which is a mainnet that will run the dMud games created by both dMud core team and users. The dMud Creator Studio is a place where users have tools and libraries to access all information required in building their own game. 
    * dMud V2 plans to leverage generative AI to add more visuals to games created on dMud.
